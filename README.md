# portfolio-project

This is my first portfolio I have created. It contains a nav bar with links that scroll to that corresponding section on the page. It also has a small blurb about myself and it also includes some images that will link to future projects I have yet to build.

At the bottom, there is a small section that contains pertinent contact information.

Here is a screenshot and the portfolio URL.
